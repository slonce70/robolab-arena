## Iteration 1 - Pause Room Intel

Goal: make the 12-room game easier to understand without weakening gameplay.

Changes:
- Added a pause-screen room intel panel with objective, threats, support pickups, and tactical guidance.
- Added `levelIntel` helpers that derive the guidance from existing level config instead of duplicating room data in UI code.
- Added tests to ensure every room has actionable pause guidance and that boss/laser rooms mention the right tactics.
- Verified the panel in Playwright with a screenshot artifact.

Evidence:
- `node .omx/tmp/robolab-room-intel-qa.mjs` -> `room-intel-playwright-pass`, 4 intel cards, 0 bad console, 0 page errors.
- `npm test` -> 14 files, 52 tests passed.
- `npm run build` -> success with the known Vite large chunk warning.
- `git diff --check` -> clean.

Artifact:
- `output/playwright/overnight-room-intel-2026-04-26/pause-room-intel.png`
- `output/playwright/overnight-room-intel-2026-04-26/report.json`

Remaining risk:
- The intel is text/UI guidance only; it does not replace a no-jump human victory run.
